<p style="font-family: Abadi MT Condensed Light; font-size: 17pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family, at least on my dad's side, is pretty well documented. My grandpa actually made a book about the records of the family when my dad was only a child. My dad has a copy, and I have seen the contents. It details each member of the family back multiple generations, and lists where they lived. The grandparents of my grandparents actually were born in Germany, and sometime after the Civil War, they moved to the U.S. What is amazing about this is that my grandpa created all of this before the internet existed. He went through records and asked extended family what they knew. He even has some of the original emigration records. We may know a lot about my dad's family, but we don't anything about my mom's side. We think it might be Irish, but beyond that, we have no clue.
